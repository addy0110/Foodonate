# Inspiration

Wasting food is a common problem in our society. The streets, garbage bins and landfills have ample proof to prove it. Marriages, canteens, restaurants, social and family get-togethers and functions expel so much food. Food wastage is not only an indication of hunger or pollution, but also of many economic problems. The high standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting them we can put them in use by donating them to various organisations such as orphanages, old age homes, etc. We have identified the use of mobile technology to reduce food waste management and built an android mobile application that allows food donors, restaurants/individuals to donate and share their foods and leftovers with people in need. 

The ultimate objective of this project is to communicate that investments in food wastage reduction is the most logical step in the pursuit of sustainable production and consumption, including food security, climate change and other adverse environmental effects. Public awareness materials and a strategy will be developed to this effect.

# What's next for Foodonate

Addition of a more efficient model will increase the ability to detect fraud and give authentication to the correct organisations only. Our project will need support from various places where food wastage is most common, and also, we will need fast delivery of food before it gets spoiled, so donor’s support and delivery organisations are our critical success factors. We expect that our app will scale well.
